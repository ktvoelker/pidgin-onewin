Pidgin Onewin TODO
==================

Make Ctrl-Tab work when the conversations are focused.

Add a keyboard shortcut for swapping focus between the Buddy List (if the
focus is anywhere in the conversation area) and the conversation window (if
the focus is anywhere in the Buddy List area).

Make the text-entry area be focused when a new conversation is manually
opened. Note that this is a special, automatic invocation of the previous
item.

Merge the menu bars so the Buddy List can be made narrower than its menus
without hiding them.

Figure out how to run code when the plugin is enabled, and set our
conversation placement mode automatically at that time.

Make it not segfault when quitting.
