Pidgin Onewin TODO
==================

Commit the code in Monotone for conformity's sake.

Post to devel@pidgin.im about what I'm up to.

Make it not segfault when quitting.

Make Ctrl-Tab work.

Make the color of conversation tab titles properly reset to normal when the tab
is focused in any way.

Make the text-entry area be focused when a new conversation is opened.

Change the Buddy List's size request to be very small, and then set the divider
position at a reasonable default.

Merge the menu bars so the Buddy List can be made narrower than its menus
without hiding them.

Change the metadata in the plugin.
